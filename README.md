Study a set of vocabulary by entering it over and over! Learn Japanese! lol

The reason I make it "spam" is because you have to enter the text multiple times for it to count as correct. This solidifies your mind in the learning process, especially for people who are Tactile learners. see http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-styles.shtml for details on that theory stuff folks.


HOW TO RUN IT:

Download the Spamstudy.jar file and other .txt files. also make sure you have Java 7 or later. 

        if the JARs do not open, consider running https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51610798/jarfix.exe on your machine to fix the issue. 
        this is usually related to bad .JAR file associations on windows.

CONTROLS:

        enter the correct text on the top
        type ? to get the answers
        type status to get you progress


Inputs:
a list of things to learn. example:

        Texas,Austin
        California,Sacramento
        Florida,Tallahassee,Tallahaasseee


You can put multiple arguments. The first word is the Word to learn, and then the rest of the words are "correct answers".



Outputs:

a resizable java window opens and you can enter in your text to quiz yourself. See http://imgur.com/a/Q4qmo 


Customization:

Open the spamstudysettings.txt for a few settings:

        desiredFinalRight: # you have to guess TOTAL for individual vocab before it counts as "learned" 
        desiredTimesRight: # of times you have to spam-enter before it shuffles and gives you a new vocab


You can make your own set of quizzes. A few quizzes come with the program. I personally used these provided files myself in 2014 to memorize Hiragana and Katakana.
